# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skimr::skim(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler's weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let's create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

```{r, mutate_and_count}



```

Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r, ci_using_formulas}

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don't.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I`

```{r}

```

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives.

We were asked to carry out the analysis to find out whether there is a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and if there are any discrimination factors.

## Loading the data

Omega Group Plc. had shared data of 50 employees with us. The data was inspected before conducting our analysis and we have noted that there were no missing/incomplete data points.

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
skimr::skim(omega)
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega` contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion

. Confidence intervals . Hypothesis testing . Correlation analysis . Regression

Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

We have constructed a visualisation that shows the salary trend between male and female employees:

```{r, salary_visualisation}

#Extra Visual
ggplot(omega) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  aes(x = salary, y = gender, colour = gender) + 
  labs (x = "Salary", y = "Gender", caption = "Source: Omega Plc salary data", title = "Male employees at Omega Plc have a higher salary than females", subtitle = "Boxplot showing the salary trend between males and females at Omega Plc")
```

The above graph shows a visual difference between the average distribtions of salary between female and male salary's for Omega Plc. The group decided to extrapolate the data and construct tables depict these initial findings.

```{r, salary_table}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega) 

#Summary Stats 

summary_stats <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            sd_salary = sd(salary),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_salary = sd(salary)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_salary,
            salary_low = mean_salary - margin_of_error,
            salary_high = mean_salary + margin_of_error)

summary_stats

obs_diff <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

p_val <- summary_stats %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

From the initial analysis in the table above, it is shown that males have a higher mean salary of 8696 than females. We decided that more analysis is required to determine if this difference is significant and to decide if there are any further analysis required to uncover influencing factors.

### Advanced Analysis

The team decided to conduct 2 tests to decide if the difference in mean salary's between males and females were significant. The following tests were decided upon:

1.  Hypothesis Tesing useing the T Test package
2.  T Test using simulation method and infer packages

#### Hypothesis Tesing using the T Test package

The T Test package was used to assess if there is a true difference in the salaries, and findings form this built-in test shows that there is indeed a significant difference as indicated by the absolute T-Value being greater than 1.96, and the P-Value being smaller than 5%.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_ttest}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

We also ran a hypothesis test, assuming that the mean difference in salaries is zero as the null hypothesis using the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_infer}
# hypothesis testing using infer package

library(infer)
set.seed(1234)
infer_stats <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence",) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type ="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

percentile_ci <- infer_stats %>% get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

visualize(infer_stats) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")
percentile_ci

```

From both tests conducted, we can conclude that the observed difference in the means of salaries between males and females at Omega Plc is indeed a significant difference.

As depicted in the simulation density visualisation above, we can see that the observed difference is passed the Upper 95% percentile of 4829. This is confirmed by the t.test() performed that states the absolute T-value as 4, which is much bigger than the standard acceptable value of 1.96. Additionally, the p-value was smaller than 1%.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of experience by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

#Summary Stats
summary_stats_exp <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_experience = mean(experience),
            sd_experience = sd(experience),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_experience = sd(experience)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_experience,
            experience_low = mean_experience - margin_of_error,
            experience_high = mean_experience + margin_of_error)

summary_stats_exp


```

The above data shows a difference in experience mean of 13.74 years between females and males. To establish if the observation is a significant difference, further analysis is required.

```{r , t test experience}
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

```

Further analysis was conducted in the form of a T Test to assess the if there is any significant differences in experience between genders. The following test show the statistical variables for Omega Plc.The findings show that there is a significant difference in the experience between males and females from Omega Plc, shown by the observed t-value is greater than 1.96 and a small p-value. This finding assists in validating the pervious observation - as the average experience of males suggests reason as to why the salaries of genders are different.

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

To further substantiate the findings from the previous tests conducted, a final visual check is performed to determine if there have been any discrimination against females at Omega Plc.

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(omega)+
  aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = gender)+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Experience", y = "Salary", title = "Female's yearly increases are greater than that of men", subtitle = "Scatterplot showing the distribution of salary versus experience for males and females.")


```

The plot shows that there are a greater proportion of female employees at Omega Plc with less than 10 years of experience as compared to males, while there is a greater proportion of males with more than 10 years of experience than females at the company

## Correlation checks between gender, experience, and salary

The following graph shows a visual matrix of how gender and experience affect salary.

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

The visual assessing salary and experience for various genders shows the same finding as described in the visual before.

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data, eval=FALSE}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  ?????????????????????????

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?

```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?

> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
